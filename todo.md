# NFTEarth App TODO.md

This repo serves as part of task-management for the overall roadmap, tasks that require software updates can be most effectively completed using GitHub.

## Todo

### Contract Tasks:

- [ ] Deploy NFTE to Arbitrum Nova
- [ ] Deploy Seaport 1.5 
- [ ] Deploy Wrapper Contract for trading incentive campaigns

### Staking Tasks: 

- [ ] Add Epoch countdown timer on Staking Page that resets every 7 days at 00:00 UTC Thursday
- [ ] Add % of total NFTE tokens locked on Staking page and NFTE LP page 
  - [ ] This % is of the entire NFTE token supply (so X / 100,000,000 * 100 and expressed in %) - example: if 3,456,000 tokens staked in xNFTE, page should be rendering 3.46% NFTE tokens locked.
- [ ] MAX TIME bug in UI - as the MINTIME and MAXTIME are in UNIX, we need to change the inputs from 1-12 (months) to correspond with the smart contract precise timing otherwise it reverts in many edge cases/makes the UX confusing.
- [ ] When a very low balance of NFTE-LP in wallet and user clicks `stake` UI shows "Application error: a client-side exception has occurred (see the browser console for more information)." What is cause of this?
 - [ ] If user has less than $.01 in NFTE LP could we disable stake button as a potential solve?
 - [ ] Could this redirect to "You need more NFTE LP"?
- [ ] Fix the PWA bug needing to exit PWA to complete Txs
- [ ] MAX $NFTE Button is not supplying Maximum amount in wallet on add liquidity page.

### Marketplace Tasks:

- [ ] Add support for Arbitrum Nova
- [ ] Collection Bids and individual NFT offers bug for NFTE and ARB on Arbitrum

### In Progress:

- [ ] APR Calculation for stakers - the total global APR can be reported and updated dynamically every week based on the token price and total amount deposited to the Revenue Sharing Vault.
- [ ] Create Financial Reporting Documents for each Epoch that show sources of DAO revenue by category, (ie Marketplace, NFT Collection Mint fees, NFT Collection Royalties, LP fees). Ideally link to onchain Txs like the page from FraxFacts

### Done âœ“

- [x] Add Links to Gamma Vaults
- [x] Cleanup UI Color Pallete for consistency
- [x] Approvals for token allowances fixed 
- [x] Claiming button for stakers - 1 column required instead of 3 since only using Arbitrum at the moment. 
- [x] Finalize calculation of First Epoch Revenue Share- [x] Ensure the claiming of first Epoch lockers will be available at 00:00 UTC Thursday, September 28 (beginning of Epoch 2)
- [x] Transaction receipts per/chain - link to Etherscan, need to reflect each chain the user is on.
- [x] Arbitrum Odyssey Reignited:
- [x] Deploy NFT Collection to Arbitrum
- [x] Get page for LowFeeNFT fully integrated into NFTEarth App
